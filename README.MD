Source code for the Meaning Extraction Helper (MEH) program.
[https://www.ryanboyd.io/software/meh](https://www.ryanboyd.io/software/meh)

This is a complete C# rebuild of the original MEH. A lot of the older features have been removed, and implementation of most features in this version (starting with version 2.0.0) are far more efficient, both in terms of methodology as well as their use of the user's hardware.

As with most things, this software stands on the shoulders of giants. The work of others that makes MEH possible includes (but is probably not limited to):

-LemmaGen v3 Prebuilt/Pretrained Lemmatizers:
